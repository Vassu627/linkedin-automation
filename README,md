## 🕵️ Anti-Detection & Stealth Techniques

Implemented stealth mechanisms include:

1. Randomized timing & think delays  
2. Human-like mouse movement with overshoot & correction  
3. Human-like typing with variable speed & corrections  
4. Natural scrolling behavior with pauses  
5. Activity scheduling (business hours only)  
6. Rate limiting & daily quotas  
7. Browser fingerprint masking  
   - disabled automation flags  
   - randomized viewport  
   - `navigator.webdriver` override  
8. Duplicate action prevention via persisted state

## 🔐 Authentication System (PoC)

- Credentials loaded via environment variables
- Graceful handling of:
  - login failures
  - security checkpoints (2FA / captcha)
- No security mechanisms are bypassed

---

## 🔍 Search & Targeting (Mock)

- Query-based targeting (job title, company, keywords)
- Pagination handling
- Duplicate profile detection
- Safe mock implementation (no scraping)

---

## 🤝 Connection Requests (Mock)

- Profile visit simulation
- Daily request limits
- Human-like delays
- Persistent tracking to avoid duplicates

---

## 💬 Messaging System (Mock)

- Template-based messages
- Dynamic variable substitution
- Follow-up messaging
- Message history tracking

---

## 💾 State Persistence

- JSON-based storage
- Tracks sent connections & messages
- Enables safe resume after restarts
